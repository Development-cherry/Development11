            <p><center><h4>Brief History</h4></center>
                The initial anime adaptation of Akira Toriyama's manga, the Dragon Ball series, comprised 153 episodes, each running for 20 minutes. It aired on Fuji TV from February 26, 1986, to April 12, 1989. However, the series underwent a significant shift with the introduction of Dragon Ball Z, coinciding with Goku's transition to adulthood.
                
                Originally titled Dragon Boy, the series featured a protagonist named Tangtong and centered around his quest to rescue a princess and return her safely to her homeland. However, the series failed to meet expectations, prompting Toriyama to reimagine it into what we now know as the Dragon Ball series.
                
                This revamped iteration of Dragon Boy quickly gained widespread popularity among shounen enthusiasts worldwide. While many characters underwent personality changes in the Dragon Ball series, Goku remained true to his roots from the Dragon Boy storyline. With over four movies and nine sagas in total, the anime continues to live up to its hype. 

            </p>
            <p><center><h4>The Plot</h4></center>
                The anime begins with a young boy named Goku, who bears a striking resemblance to a monkey, complete with an actual tail! Initially depicted as an evil being, Goku undergoes a significant transformation upon losing all his memories, emerging as a different person altogether. Teaming up with another key character named Bulma, they embark on a quest to locate the seven Dragon Balls.

                These legendary artifacts, when gathered together, have the power to summon Shenron, an eternal dragon capable of granting any wish to the summoner. Along their journey, Goku and Bulma encounter various other characters, including Yamcha, a desert bandit; Oolong, a shapeshifting pig;, Yamcha’s loyal companion; and Chi-Chi, a young girl who eventually becomes Goku’s wife.
                
                The plot thickens when Oolong intervenes to thwart the sinister plans of Emperor Pilaf, a blue Imp seeking to exploit the Dragon Balls for nefarious purposes. Goku hones his martial arts skills alongside Krillin, another central figure in the Dragon Ball series, under the tutelage of Master Roshi.
                
                Preparation for the World Martial Arts Tournament becomes the focus of Goku and his companions, as they train rigorously for the upcoming challenges. Despite initially being adversaries, Goku and Krillin forge a deep bond of friendship over the course of their training. Following the tournament's conclusion, Goku embarks on a personal quest to recover the four-star Dragon Ball, an heirloom passed down from his late grandfather.
                
                However, Goku’s journey is far from straightforward, as he finds himself pitted against the Red Ribbon Army, a terrorist organization led by the ruthless Commander Red. Their goal? To seize the Dragon Balls in order to fulfill their leader’s desire for increased height. And thus, the stage is set for the main narrative to unfold.
                
                With a total of 9 sagas and over 150 episodes, Dragon Ball unfolds its epic tale. Each episode lasts about 20 minutes, gradually ramping up in interest as the story progresses. So, let’s explore the nine sagas of Dragon Ball and see how Goku overcomes challenges, turning adversity into his strength!
            </p><center><h4>Emperor Pilaf Saga</h4></center>
            The first Dragon Ball saga is where Goku meets Bulma for the first time. One day, while Goku was finishing his chores, Bulma accidentally crashes her car into him. Bulma, surprised by Goku's survival, explains the situation to him. Goku, initially confused, mistakes Bulma's car for a monster. However, after Bulma clarifies things, they end up having a meal together at Goku's house, where Bulma spots the glowing Dragon Ball she's been searching for.

            At first, Bulma considers stealing the Dragon Ball from Goku, but he refuses to let her take it. Instead, Bulma explains the significance of the Dragon Balls and how they can summon Shenron, a dragon who can grant any wish, if they collect all seven of the Dragon Balls. She had designed the Dragon Ball Radar, which enables them to track the whereabouts of the remaining Dragon Balls anywhere on the planet. Intrigued by this, Goku agrees to join Bulma on her quest to find the rest of the Dragon Balls.
            
            As they set out on their journey, they come across a sea turtle in distress and decide to help it by defeating a humanoid-bear known as "The Bear Thief." When they return from this adventure, they meet the turtle's master, Master Roshi, who rewards Goku with the Flying Nimbus for his bravery. Additionally, after a comical incident involving Bulma revealing her underwear to Roshi (introducing the long running gag of Master Roshi being a pervert), she receives a Dragon Ball as a reward.
            
            After three days of travel to the next location, Goku and Bulma arrived at Aru Village, where they encountered chaos caused by a shapeshifter named Oolong. Oolong had been kidnapping the village's girls, prompting Goku to confront him directly. Despite being captured by Oolong initially, Goku swiftly defeated him. Oolong's true form was revealed to be a pig with the ability to change shape. After liberating the kidnapped girls, Grandma Paozu gifted Bulma another Dragon Ball  and Oolong ends up joining the group.
            
            Following the loss of their vehicle, Goku, Bulma, and Oolong found themselves stranded in the scorching Diable Desert. Bulma succumbed to the heat, leading to an encounter with Yamcha and his companion Puar. This encounter led to a showdown between Goku and Yamcha, during which Goku revealed himself as the grandson of the renowned martial artist Gohan. Despite Yamcha's attempt to steal their Dragon Balls, he was defeated by Goku in their initial confrontation. In a subsequent rematch, Yamcha suffered a broken tooth and reluctantly allowed them to leave, providing them with a car equipped with a tracker.
            
            Meanwhile, Emperor Pilaf, a small blue-skinned individual, along with his cohorts Shu and Mai, also sought the Dragon Balls. They decided to steal all the Dragon Balls from Goku and the rest of his group. In countless failed attempts, they eventually got their hands on all seven of the Dragon Balls. However, just as Emperor Pilaf was about to make his wish, Oolong intervened, demanding the world's most comfortable pair of women's undergarments. Enraged, Pilaf trapped Goku and his companions in his castle.
            
            While trapped, Goku recounted a tale of a great ape that had once wreaked havoc and killed grandfather's life. After gazing at the moon, Goku lost consciousness and transformed into the same giant ape. The following morning, Goku awoke in his normal state, but without a tail. As their quest is concluded, he embarks to begin martial arts training under Master Roshi's tutelage, bidding farewell to his friends.
            </p>
            <P><center><h4>The Tournament Saga</h4></center>
                Goku pleads with Master Roshi to train him, but Roshi instantly refuses, citing his long hiatus from training anyone. Eventually, a boy named Krillin also joins in requesting to become Master Roshi's apprentice. As Master Roshi is a pervert, he asks them he would train them if he brings him a girl. Goku and Krillin end up finding and bringing him a girl named Launch, a girl whose personality changes with a single sneeze. As promised, Master Roshi to agree to train both of them.

                After undergoing rigorous training for eight months, Goku reconnects with his friends and decides to enter the World Martial Arts tournament. While the plot is filled with various fights, the final showdown is between Goku and Jackie Chun, presenting Goku with another powerful adversary.
                
                The battle between Goku and Jackie Chun is epic and difficult. In a desperate moment, Goku almost loses, but he transforms into a great ape upon seeing the moon. However, Jackie Chun cleverly destroys the moon with a powerful Kamehameha wave and Puar transforms into a scissor to cut off Goku’s tail, reverting him back to his normal form. After a fierce battle, both Goku and Jackie Chun collapse to the ground, but Jackie Chun ultimately emerges victorious. Interestingly, it's revealed that Jackie Chun is actually Master Roshi himself, adding an unexpected twist to the saga.

            <p><center><h4>The Red Ribbon Army Saga</h4></center>
            </p>The Red Ribbon Army Saga, which follows Goku's encounters with the notorious Red Ribbon Army, marks the third major storyline in the original Dragon Ball series. The saga kicks off with Goku facing off against Colonial Silver and aiding Pilaf and his crew. Along the way, Goku crosses paths with the Red Ribbon Army, a formidable group also seeking the Dragon Balls.

            Throughout this saga, Goku engages in battles with Silver, infiltrates Muscle Tower, confronts ninja Murasaki, and ultimately encounters Android 8, a peaceful creation of the Red Ribbon Army. Despite being the army's ultimate weapon, Android 8 rejects violence and allies with Goku.

            <p><center><h4>General Blue Saga</h4></center>
                The saga begins with Bulma's quest to repair her Dragon Ball radar. Once fixed, the radar reveals the location of a Dragon Ball submerged underwater. Determined to retrieve it, the team utilizes Master Roshi's submarine for the underwater expedition. During the search, our heroes, accompanied by Krillin, encounter General Blue, a self-absorbed military leader with an inflated ego.

                The confrontation escalates into a battle between Goku and General Blue. Initially, General Blue gains the upper hand by paralyzing Goku with his extraordinary abilities. However, his fear of a rodent triggers a mental breakdown, releasing Goku from the paralysis. In the end, Goku emerges victorious, securing the Dragon Ball before exiting the collapsing cave. Notably, this saga features a cameo appearance from Arale, the protagonist of the series Dr. Slump, who intervenes to save Goku from General Blue's imminent threat.
                
                Despite their success in obtaining one Dragon Ball, Goku and his companions recognize that their quest is far from over, prompting them to continue their pursuit of the remaining Dragon Balls.

            <p><center><h4>Commander Red Saga</h4></center>
                The Commander Red Saga marks the return of the Red Ribbon Army as the central antagonists.

                In a bid to revive Upa's deceased father, whom Goku inadvertently caused the demise of, Goku embarks on a journey to climb Korin Tower. However, reaching the tower's summit proves to be a daunting task. Upon reaching the top, Goku encounters Korin, who is revealed to be a wise cat. Goku engages in a challenging battle with Korin, during which he learns valuable lessons and obtains the sacred water from the tower.
                
                Meanwhile, Mercenary Tao resurfaces and targets Goku once again in his pursuit of the Dragon Balls. Despite Tao's renewed efforts, Goku emerges victorious in their battle. With Tao defeated, Goku sets his sights on the Red Ribbon Army's headquarters to retrieve the remaining Dragon Balls.
                
                As the saga unfolds, only one Dragon Ball remains unaccounted for, and the team's efforts to locate it using the Dragon radar prove futile. Faced with this setback, Goku and his companions resolve to seek assistance from Master Roshi, setting the stage for the next phase of their quest.
            </p>
            <p><center><h4>Fortune Teller Baba’s Saga</h4></center>

                However, before reaching their destination, they must undergo rigorous training and face the challenges posed by Fortune Teller Baba's five formidable warriors. It is only after overcoming these trials that they gain access to the location of the last Dragon Ball.
                
                The climactic battle with Emperor Pilaf takes place here, culminating in Goku and his team emerging victorious. With the location of the seventh Dragon Ball finally revealed to be in Pilaf's possession, Goku and his companions engage in a fierce confrontation to obtain it.
                
                Upon securing the final Dragon Ball, the group heads towards Korin Tower to fulfill their ultimate goal. By successfully using the Dragon Balls to resurrect Upa's father, they achieve a joyful conclusion to their journey. However, Goku's unexpected acquisition of the four-star Dragon Ball adds an intriguing twist to the tale as he departs with it, hinting at further adventures to come.

The tournament sees Tien facing off against Goku in a pivotal showdown that alters the course of the Dragon Ball storyline.

                Throughout the tournament, Tien and Chiaotzu manipulate the match-ups, resulting in Chiaotzu squaring off against Krillin and Tien against Jackie Chun. However, it is the final showdown between Goku and Tien that leaves a lasting impact. Despite Goku's valiant efforts, Tien emerges victorious, but his dissatisfaction with the win prompts him to offer Goku half of the prize money, signaling a significant change of heart.
